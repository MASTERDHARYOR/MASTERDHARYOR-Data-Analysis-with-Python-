Executive Overview:

Data Context & Preparation
The underlying data is sourced from a public Kaggle dataset centered on e-commerce consumer behavior. Prior to visualization, data was meticulously cleansed and transformed using Power Query. Custom calculations and segmentation measures were defined with DAX to extract meaningful KPIs and to derive actionable insights. This unified approach ensures that both demographic and transactional dimensionsare seamlessly integrated for deeper analysis.

Consumer Demographics

The first dashboard explores customer profiles through a variety of lenses:
•	Customer Segmentation & Distribution:
The data reveals distinct age groups and income segments, highlighting that the majority of customers are in the mid-career bracket. Gender distribution is almost balanced, while specific non-binary or alternative gender categories, though smaller, provide additional nuance to the customer base.
•	Geographic & Income Analysis:
Visualizations map out regional sales performance and correlate spending behavior with income levels, enabling targeted regional marketing initiatives. These insights allow the organization to pinpoint high-revenue areas and develop tailored campaigns.

Purchasing Behavior & Sales Trends

The second dashboard shifts the focus to transactional metrics:
•	Sales Dynamics & Purchase Frequency:
Through bar charts and time series analysis, trends in purchase categories, channels, and discount usage are brought to light. The KPI cards summarize total sales, average purchase values, and overall purchase counts, setting the stage for understanding revenue drivers.
•	Channel & Discount Impact:
Pie charts and stacked column visuals break down the contributions of various sales channels—online, in-store, and mixed methods—while also distinguishing between discounted and full-price transactions. This differentiation helps in assessing the effectiveness of discount strategies and their influence on revenue.

Interconnected Analysis
By linking the two dashboards, several key strategic insights emerge:
•	Customer Value Identification:
High-value segments identified in the demographics dashboard correlate with stronger purchasing patterns observed in the sales dashboard. For instance, the predominant age groups and income brackets are also the primary contributors to total sales. This alignment supports initiatives aimed at nurturing these segments through loyalty programs and personalized marketing.
•	Channel Optimization:
Demographic insights, such as geographic distribution and age, when mapped alongside purchase channel performance, reveal which customer groups prefer online versus in-store experiences. This holistic view aids in optimizing resource allocation across channels.
•	Discount & Retention Strategies:
Analyzing discount impact alongside customer segmentation provides a window into pricing sensitivity and retention. Understanding that certain demographic segments respond more favorably to promotions allows for smarter discounting strategies that drive both immediate sales and long-term loyalty.
